        <h3>Howla Technologies Privacy Policy</h3> 
          <p> Privacy is important to Howla Technologies. This privacy policy
           ("Privacy Policy") applies to the Howla Technologies websites and
            explains how personal information is collected, used, disclosed, 
            and protected by Howla Technologies.<p>

        <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. 
            If we make any changes to this Privacy Policy, 
            we will inform you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Howla Technologies website. Those changes will go into effect on the "last updated" date shown in the revised Privacy Policy. You consent to the revised Privacy Policy by continuing to use Howla Technologies Services. We encourage you to check this Privacy Policy whenever you use Howla 
            Technologies Services to understand how your personal 
            information is used.
          </p>
        <h3>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h3>
          <p>
            In your dealings with Howla Technologies you may provide
            us with personal information. Personal information for the 
            purposes of this Privacy Policy means information that personally
              identifies you, like your name, street address, email address, 
              phone number, and other personally identifiable information 
              that you choose to give to us or that we collect in relation to 
              your use of the Howla Technologies Services. This Privacy Policy 
              does not apply to the practices of entities that we do not own or 
              control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
          </p>
        <h3>No information from Minors under 13</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a minor less than 13 years old, 
            please do not register for Howla Technologies Services 
            or provide any personal information about yourself to us. 
            If we learn that we have collected personal information from such a minor,
            we will delete that information. If you are a parent of a minor,
              you may provide us with personal information about the minor, 
              or permit us to collect information directly from the minor

              otherwise tailor our services. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts
                or limits our collection and use of aggregate data, and we may share
                aggregate data about our users with third parties for various 
                purposes, including to help us better understand our customer 
                needs and improve our services and for advertising and marketing 
                purposes.
